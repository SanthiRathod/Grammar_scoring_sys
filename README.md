# Grammar Scoring Engine for Voice Samples - Project Overview

"""
This notebook provides an overview and description of the Grammar Scoring Engine project,
which was part of the SHL Intern Hiring Assessment hosted on Kaggle.
"""

#  Problem Statement
"""
You are tasked with building a Grammar Scoring Engine that predicts grammar proficiency
scores (ranging from 0.0 to 5.0) from spoken English audio samples. Each audio file is
between 45 to 60 seconds long.
"""

#  Dataset Components
"""
- train.csv: Contains filenames and corresponding grammar scores
- test.csv: Contains filenames for which scores are to be predicted
- audios_train/: Directory with training audio files
- audios_test/: Directory with testing audio files
- sample_submission.csv: Template for the submission file
"""

#  Evaluation Metric
"""
Pearson Correlation Coefficient between actual and predicted grammar scores.
"""

#  Approach Summary

## 1. Feature Extraction
"""
- Use Librosa to extract audio features:
    - MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)
    - Chroma features
    - Zero Crossing Rate
    - Spectral Centroid
- Standardize features by computing mean and standard deviation
"""

## 2. Model Training
"""
- Train a regression model (Random Forest Regressor)
- Perform validation using train-test split (e.g., 80/20)
- Evaluate performance using MAE and RÂ² score
"""

## 3. Prediction and Submission
"""
- Extract features from test audio
- Predict grammar scores
- Format and save the submission file
"""

#  Potential Improvements
"""
- Use deep learning models (CNNs on spectrograms)
- Experiment with ensemble models (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Apply audio data augmentation
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
"""

#  Goal
"""
Create a robust and accurate model capable of predicting grammar scores from voice samples,
and perform well on the Kaggle leaderboard.
